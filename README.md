# What-does-the-fox-say-
This program was suprisingly difficult for me.
The program first reads in the text file
the first 2 lines from the file go into the FoxTalks array list and the other 4 goes into another array list
The porgram the searches for matching words found in the 2 lists
if a word in animals_list is found in foxtalk_list it is removed from the foxtalk_list
